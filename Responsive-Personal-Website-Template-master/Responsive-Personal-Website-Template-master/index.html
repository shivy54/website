          Personal project
        </p>
        <p class="nameabout">
          My personal project is one of learning a new coding langauge specifically React JSX. After learning the langauge
          I will be creating an app which has only one function. This function is too collect the monthly newsletter of the school 
          and allow parents access the newsletter comfotably

        <h1>Personal Interest</h1>
        <p class="nameabout"> 
          What sparked my interest in this topic was a long-lasting curiosity of how machines and computers
          work. This coupled with one of my possible future paths being a coder/programmer. I obtained the idea that I can use
          the opportunity of a Personal Project to see if I want to take up this field in the future as well. This type of
          project is something which works with my passion for computers and a way to figure out my future endeavours.
          This will be very helpful for me. </p>

              learn a new langauge, research was the cornerstone of it.I mainly learned from
              Youtube and other Webisites. Also utilised both Primary and Secondary research.

        <h1>Journey</h1>
        <p class="nameabout">
          As I embarked on my personal project, I quickly realized that it would be heavily reliant on research. I had to delve into a variety of topics and learn a lot of new information in order to proceed. Despite the fact that I was excited about the project, I was also a bit intimidated by the amount of work that lay ahead of me.

As I began to program, I encountered a number of problems and complications. I found myself struggling to implement certain features and overcome technical obstacles. Despite these challenges, I refused to be discouraged. Instead, I drew upon my determination and perseverance to push through the difficulties.

Through hours of hard work and dedication, I was able to complete my project. Along the way, I learned a lot about the subject matter, as well as about myself and my ability to overcome obstacles. In the end, it was all worth it as I was able to achieve my goal and proud of what I have accomplished        </p>
